An Android app for Transport for London's bus arrival time system with an accessibility focus.

Accessibility considerations

- High contrast text
White text on black. Respects Android large text accessibility option.

- Tested with sensible screen reader behaviour

- Minimal use of menus
Attempts to avoid the use of the extra menu items dialog; all functions should be directly clickable.
Application opens on the arrivals screen for user's nearest favourite stop if the devices late known location is available.

- Favours textual representation of stop lists
Defaults to rendering nearby stops in list form rather than on a map.
Tries to assist visually impaired users to visualise the relationship between stops by providing distance and direction information.
Attempts to geocode phone location latitude/longitudes into understandable nearby street names.

- Attempts to correct potentially confusing abbreviations used in the source data.
ie. 'Hounslow Bus St' is corrected to 'Hounslow Bus Street' before been presented to the Android screen reader.

This app received a highly commended award in Transport for London's 2013 accessible app competition.
