Accessibility considerations

- High contrast text
White text on black. Respects Android large text accessibility option.

- Minimal use of menus
Attempts to avoid the use of the extra menu items dialog; all functions should be directly clickable.
Application opens on the arrivals screen for user's nearest favourite stop if the devices late known location is available.

- Favours textual representation of stop lists
Defaults to rendering nearly stops in list form rather than on a map.
Tries to assist visually impaired users to visualise the relationship between stops by providing distance and direction information.
Attempts to geocode phone location latitude/longitudes into understandable nearby street name.

- Attempts to correct potentially confusing abbreviations used in the source data.
ie. 'Hounslow Bus St' reads as 'Hounslow Bus Street' to the Android screen reader.
